//! A library implementing a URL for use in git with access to its special capabilities.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```
//! let mut url = gix_url::parse("ssh://git@example.com/gitoxide").unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(url.user(), Some("git"));
//! assert_eq!(url.host(), Some("example.com"));
//! assert_eq!(url.to_bstring(), "ssh://git@example.com/gitoxide");
//!
//! assert_eq!(url.set_user(Some("byron".into())), Some("git".into()));
//! assert_eq!(url.user_argument_safe(), Some("byron"));
//! assert_eq!(url.to_bstring(), "ssh://byron@example.com/gitoxide");
//!
//! let suspicious = gix_url::parse("ssh://-Fconfig@host/repo").unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(suspicious.user_argument_safe(), None, "The user isn't returned as it looks like an argument");
